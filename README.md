This map identifies in purple the census block groups eligible for the Connect America Phase II auction (Auction 903), which will use competitive bidding to allocate up to $1.98 billion of support over 10 years in high-cost areas served by larger telephone providers (called price cap carriers).  Census blocks with eligible locations within eligible census block groups are indicated in orange.  Clicking on a census block group displays additional information for that census block group, including the total number of supported locations and the total annual reserve price rounded to the nearest dollar (as proposed by the Commission, the sum of the annual support amounts calculated for all locations within each eligible census block in the census block group, subject to a $146.10 per-location-per-month cap). 

The Commission made eligible for Auction 903 high-cost census blocks in states where the price cap carriers declined an earlier [offer of model-based support](https://www.fcc.gov/maps/caf-2-accepted-map/)  and other unserved areas nationwide (excluding Alaska, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) that are not served by the incumbent price cap carrier or an unsubsidized service provider with voice and broadband at speeds of 10/1 Mbps or higher.  The Commission has proposed that census block groups will be the minimum geographic unit for bidding.  Thus, parties will be required to bid on all of the locations within the eligible census blocks of each census block group, if ultimately adopted by the Commission as the minimum geographic unit. 

As directed by the Commission, the Bureau is publishing the final list of eligible census blocks, based on the most recent publicly available FCC Form 477 data (as of December 31, 2016), at least three months prior to the deadline for submission of short-form applications for the Phase II auction.
